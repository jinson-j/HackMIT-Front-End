## Inspiration
Hospitals are places of great care and love. Indeed, they work hard to ensure every patient receives the utmost care in the possible most efficient way. However, they do not always successfully establish a system to improve task management and care-to-next-care time turnover. Traditional, this is done by backward "Nokia" phones or simply yelling down the hallway. We are here to fix that! Our system will help you effectively handle task dispatches so that most patients can be accommodated for the most effective care.

## What it does
We have created an efficient ticketing system so doctors can register tasks assigned to available assistants depending on their schedules and duration from the last HIGH priority task. To make accessibly easier in sterile conditions, we support a voice-over, hands-free system to register tasks. Additionally, it keeps track of KPI information on the dashboard.

## How we built it
We build it on a React frontend server backed by Node.Js back-end and PostgreSQL on supabase. For our speech-to-text feature, we leveraged IBM Watson's speech-to-text service. 

## Challenges we ran into
Setting up IBM Waston speech-to-text service.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The Sassy front-end finish and the seamless functionality of the app. We are also proud of the feasibility and applicability of the idea.

## What we learned
We learned how to integrate multiple APIs and data management over the back-end. We learned the importance of structuring the front end on layered bits.

## What's next for Velox
Integrating inventory tracking and analysis for the efficacious supply chain to dive into a market of caring for both the medical and supply-chain aspects of hospitals
